              <h3>Design philosophy</h3>
              <p>LumiLedger is architected around a core principle: data preparation should be transparent, traceable, and grounded in accounting logic.</p>
              <p>The system does not attempt to replace professional judgment. It prepares financial data in a way that makes professional judgment easier to apply.</p>
              <p>Every design decision reflects this boundary.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="content-card">
              <h3>Source-driven data model</h3>
              <p>LumiLedger is built on a source-driven architecture. Every transaction must be tied to a known, connected financial account.</p>
              <p>This approach ensures that coverage is explicit. If an account is not connected, its activity is not included. This prevents silent incompleteness.</p>
              <p>Users always know what is being measured and what is not.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="content-card wide">
              <h3>Data flow</h3>
              <div class="arch-flow">
                <div class="flow-step">
                  <div class="flow-step-title">Account connection</div>
                  <p>Business owners connect bank accounts, credit cards, and loans through secure integrations. These become the system's known sources of financial activity.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="flow-step">
                  <div class="flow-step-title">Transaction ingestion</div>
                  <p>Transactions are imported daily from connected accounts. Each transaction includes date, amount, description, and source account information.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="flow-step">
                  <div class="flow-step-title">Journal entry generation</div>
                  <p>For each transaction, a journal entry is created. One side is anchored to the known source account. The offsetting side is classified using machine-learned logic and AI assistance.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="flow-step">
                  <div class="flow-step-title">Financial statement construction</div>
                  <p>Journal entries are aggregated into financial statements following standard accounting structure. Income Statements, Balance Sheets, and General Ledger views are generated automatically.</p>

              <h3>Classification logic</h3>
              <p>LumiLedger classifies transactions using a combination of machine-learned patterns and AI-assisted reasoning.</p>
              <p>Each classification is transparent and includes a confidence score. Users and advisors can review, adjust, or override any classification.</p>
              <p>Over time, the system learns from corrections and adapts to business-specific patterns.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="content-card">
              <h3>Handling commingled accounts</h3>
              <p>LumiLedger recognizes that many small businesses use personal accounts for business activity.</p>
              <p>Personal accounts can be connected intentionally. Each transaction is classified as either business or personal at the transaction level.</p>
              <p>This allows for accurate separation while maintaining complete visibility into all activity.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="content-card">
              <h3>Balance sheet integrity</h3>
              <p>LumiLedger maintains balance sheet integrity by tracking all connected account balances and ensuring that journal entries always balance.</p>
              <p>Cash and credit card liabilities are reconciled against known account balances. Discrepancies are surfaced rather than hidden.</p>
              <p>This prevents drift between reported financials and actual account positions.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="content-card">
              <h3>Data boundaries</h3>
              <p>LumiLedger does not infer activity from accounts that are not connected. It does not estimate missing data or fill gaps with assumptions.</p>
              <p>Coverage is explicit. Completeness is visible.</p>
              <p>This boundary is intentional and reflects a commitment to transparency over false confidence.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="content-card wide">
              <h3>System boundaries</h3>
              <p>LumiLedger does not make tax elections, enforce accounting method choices, or assert compliance authority.</p>
              <p>It generates financial statements for understanding and analysis, not for filing or formal compliance.</p>
              <p>When compliance is required, LumiLedger hands off clean, structured data to an accounting platform where professional judgment is applied.</p>
              <p>This boundary preserves professional authority and prevents the system from overstepping its role.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="content-card">
              <h3>Export and integration</h3>
              <p>LumiLedger supports clean export of journal entries, financial statements, and transaction detail.</p>
              <p>Data can be transferred to QuickBooks, Excel, or other accounting platforms when formal record-keeping is required.</p>
              <p>This flexibility allows LumiLedger to serve as a preparation layer without locking users into a single ecosystem.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="content-card">
              <h3>Security and privacy</h3>
              <p>All financial data is encrypted in transit and at rest. Account connections use industry-standard secure integrations.</p>
              <p>Data is never sold or used for purposes outside of the user's financial preparation.</p>
              <p>Access controls ensure that only authorized users and advisors can view financial information.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="content-card wide">
              <h3>Scalability and performance</h3>
              <p>LumiLedger is built to handle businesses with hundreds of transactions per month across multiple accounts.</p>
              <p>The system processes transactions in near real-time and updates financial statements daily.</p>
              <p>Performance remains consistent as transaction volume grows, ensuring that the system can support businesses as they scale.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="content-card">
              <h3>Continuous improvement</h3>
              <p>Classification logic improves over time as more data is processed and more corrections are applied.</p>
              <p>System updates are deployed regularly to improve accuracy, add features, and refine the user experience.</p>
              <p>Feedback from users and accounting professionals is incorporated into ongoing development.</p>
