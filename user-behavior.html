              <h3>The reality of small business behavior</h3>
              <p>Small business owners are not ignoring their finances. They are managing businesses with limited time, competing priorities, and uneven financial literacy.</p>
              <p>Most want clarity. Few have the time or background to extract it from raw financial data.</p>
              <p>LumiLedger is designed for this reality.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="content-card">
              <h3>Why most tools fail to stick</h3>
              <p>Many financial tools assume fluency in accounting concepts, consistent data entry habits, and sustained engagement.</p>
              <p>In practice, small business owners use these tools sporadically, enter data inconsistently, and abandon them when the learning curve exceeds perceived value.</p>
              <p>LumiLedger does not assume fluency. It does not require sustained engagement. It works with the data that already exists.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="content-card wide">
              <h3>Meeting users where they are</h3>
              <p>LumiLedger is built around how small businesses already operate, not how we wish they would operate.</p>
              <div class="behavior-principles">
                <div class="principle-item">
                  <div class="principle-title">No manual entry required</div>
                  <p>Transactions are imported automatically from connected accounts. Users do not need to log expenses or categorize activity manually unless they choose to.</p>

                <div class="principle-item">
                  <div class="principle-title">Clarity without complexity</div>
                  <p>Financial statements are generated automatically in the background. On the surface, users see plain-English narratives that explain what is happening in their business.</p>

              <h3>Adoption through advisors</h3>
              <p>Early adoption of LumiLedger is driven by accounting professionals who introduce it to clients as part of their service offering.</p>
              <p>Clients adopt the tool because it is recommended by someone they already trust, not because they discovered it independently.</p>
              <p>This advisor-led adoption model reflects how small businesses actually make decisions about financial tools.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="content-card">
              <h3>Why advisor-led adoption works</h3>
              <p>Small business owners are more likely to adopt tools when the setup is handled for them, the value is explained clearly, and the tool integrates into an existing relationship.</p>
              <p>LumiLedger supports this model by making onboarding simple, providing clear value within the first session, and enabling collaborative use between business owners and advisors.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="content-card">
              <h3>Low-friction onboarding</h3>
              <p>LumiLedger onboarding involves connecting financial accounts and allowing the system to import historical transactions.</p>
              <p>Within minutes, users see their first financial narrative and generated statements.</p>
              <p>This immediate value reduces friction and establishes trust early.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="content-card">
              <h3>Sustained use without sustained effort</h3>
              <p>LumiLedger is designed to provide ongoing value without requiring ongoing effort.</p>
              <p>Transactions are imported automatically. Financial statements are updated daily. Narratives are generated in the background.</p>
              <p>Users who engage actively see deeper value. Users who check in occasionally still receive useful insight.</p>

              <h3>Why simplicity matters</h3>
              <p>Complexity is not sophistication. It is friction.</p>
              <p>LumiLedger prioritizes simplicity because simplicity is what allows small business owners to stay engaged without feeling overwhelmed.</p>
              <p>Professional rigor is preserved where it matters—in the underlying accounting structure, not in the surface experience.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="content-card">
              <h3>Long-term engagement</h3>
              <p>LumiLedger earns sustained use by being useful without being demanding.</p>
              <p>Users return because the tool provides clarity when they need it, not because it requires constant attention.</p>
              <p>This approach reflects how small businesses actually use financial tools over time.</p>

            <article class="content-card wide">
              <h3>Measuring success</h3>
              <p>Success is not measured by daily active users or gamified engagement metrics.</p>
              <p>Success is measured by whether business owners understand their financial position better, whether advisors spend less time on data cleanup, and whether financial conversations happen with better information.</p>
              <p>LumiLedger is built for impact, not engagement theater.</p>
