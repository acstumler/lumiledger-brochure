              <h3>The problem LumiLedger solves for you</h3>
              <p>You regularly receive incomplete, disorganized, or poorly structured financial data from small-business clients.</p>
              <p>Before advisory or compliance work can begin, you spend time reconstructing transactions, chasing down missing information, and organizing activity that should have been prepared before reaching you.</p>
              <p>LumiLedger addresses this preparation gap.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="content-card">
              <h3>What LumiLedger provides</h3>
              <p>LumiLedger prepares small-business financial data into clean, review-ready inputs. Transactions are classified, journal entries are generated, and financial statements are structured before reaching your desk.</p>
              <p>Your role shifts from data cleanup to professional review, adjustment, and advisory.</p>
              <p>This is not automation for automation's sake. It is preparation that respects your time and judgment.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="content-card wide">
              <h3>How LumiLedger fits into your workflow</h3>
              <div class="workflow-steps">
                <div class="workflow-step">
                  <div class="workflow-step-title">Client onboarding</div>
                  <p>You introduce LumiLedger to clients who need better financial visibility or whose records require regular cleanup. Setup takes minutes.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="workflow-step">
                  <div class="workflow-step-title">Ongoing preparation</div>
                  <p>LumiLedger imports transactions, classifies activity, and generates financial statements automatically. Clients gain visibility. You receive cleaner inputs.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="workflow-step">
                  <div class="workflow-step-title">Review and adjustment</div>
                  <p>You review prepared data, adjust classifications as needed, and apply professional judgment where required. Time previously spent on cleanup is now available for higher-value work.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="workflow-step">
                  <div class="workflow-step-title">Handoff to system of record</div>
                  <p>When formal compliance or filing is required, you export clean data from LumiLedger into QuickBooks or another accounting platform where final judgment is applied.</p>
                </div>
              </div>
            </article>

            <article class="content-card">
              <h3>Professional judgment is preserved</h3>
              <p>LumiLedger does not make accounting judgments, tax elections, or compliance decisions.</p>
              <p>It prepares data. You apply judgment.</p>
              <p>This boundary is intentional and reflects a commitment to supporting your authority, not replacing it.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="content-card">
              <h3>Transparency and reviewability</h3>
              <p>Every transaction classification in LumiLedger is transparent, reviewable, and adjustable. You can see why a classification was applied, what confidence level was assigned, and where uncertainty exists.</p>
              <p>You are never forced to trust a black box. The system is designed for professional review.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="content-card">
              <h3>Handling client commingling</h3>
              <p>LumiLedger is built for the reality that many small-business clients use personal accounts for business activity.</p>
              <p>Personal accounts can be connected intentionally, and transactions are classified at the transaction level. This allows you to see complete activity and advise appropriately without requiring clients to change their behavior first.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="content-card">
              <h3>When LumiLedger is sufficient</h3>
              <p>For many cash-basis, owner-managed businesses, LumiLedger provides sufficient structure for ongoing visibility, internal decision-making, and advisor conversations.</p>
              <p>Clients who do not need formal compliance systems can use LumiLedger as their primary financial tool.</p>
              <p>You remain involved as needed for advisory, tax planning, and periodic review.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="content-card">
              <h3>When handoff is required</h3>
              <p>When formal compliance, filing, or a system of record is required, LumiLedger hands off clean, structured data to your accounting platform.</p>
              <p>This flexibility allows you to use LumiLedger as a preparation layer for some clients and as a primary tool for others, depending on their needs.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="content-card wide">
              <h3>Firm-level use and customization</h3>

            </article>

            <article class="content-card">
              <h3>Client communication and education</h3>
              <p>LumiLedger generates plain-English financial narratives that help clients understand their performance without requiring accounting fluency.</p>
              <p>This improves the quality of advisory conversations by ensuring clients arrive prepared with baseline clarity.</p>
              <p>You spend less time explaining basics and more time advising on what matters.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="content-card">
              <h3>Pricing and client billing</h3>
              <p>LumiLedger can be introduced to clients as part of your service offering or billed separately depending on your practice model.</p>
              <p>Pricing is structured to support both approaches.</p>
              <p>Your relationship with the client remains primary. LumiLedger is infrastructure, not a competing service.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="content-card">
              <h3>Data security and access control</h3>
              <p>All financial data is encrypted and secured. You control which clients you have access to and what level of visibility you maintain.</p>
              <p>Clients retain ownership of their data. You are granted access as their advisor.</p>
              <p>This structure preserves professional boundaries and data governance standards.</p>

            </article>

            <article class="content-card">
              <h3>Why early adoption matters</h3>
              <p>Accounting professionals who adopt LumiLedger early gain influence over product development, access to firm-level features, and positioning as leaders in financial data preparation.</p>
              <p>Early feedback directly shapes how the product evolves.</p>
              <p>LumiLedger is being built in partnership with practitioners, not in isolation from them.</p>

            <article class="content-card">
              <h3>Long-term value</h3>
              <p>LumiLedger is designed to reduce recurring data cleanup work, improve client clarity, and shift your time toward advisory services.</p>
              <p>Over time, this shift strengthens client relationships, increases the value of your services, and allows you to serve more clients without proportional increases in administrative burden.</p>
              <p>This is infrastructure that scales with your practice.</p>
