        <h2>The Problem in Small-Business Financials</h2>
        <p class="problem-lede">A structural data problem — not a lack of effort or tools.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="problem-grid">
        <article class="problem-card">
          <h3>Where the breakdown starts</h3>
          <p>Most small businesses do not struggle because they ignore their finances. They struggle because the financial data they generate is not structured in a way that supports professional review or informed decision-making.</p>
          <p>For the majority of small businesses, records consist primarily of bank and credit card transactions spread across multiple accounts, platforms, and statements. While this activity reflects real economic behavior, it is rarely organized into a clean, consistent format before it reaches an accountant or advisor.</p>
          <div class="problem-list">
            <div>Fragmented across multiple sources</div>
            <div>Inconsistently categorized</div>
            <div>Poorly structured at the General Ledger level</div>
            <div>Difficult to trace back to original activity</div>
          </div>
          <p>Before any advisory, tax, or planning work can begin, a significant amount of time is spent reconstructing what already happened. This recurring cleanup is not an edge case — it is the norm.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="problem-card">
          <h3>Who this problem affects</h3>
          <p>Small businesses account for 99.9% of all U.S. businesses, with the vast majority employing fewer than 25 people. Firms of this size typically operate without internal accounting teams and rely on external CPAs or bookkeepers for financial review, compliance, and guidance.</p>
          <p>Within this segment, simplicity is not a preference — it is a necessity.</p>
          <p>Most businesses with 1–25 employees manage their finances using cash-basis accounting, recording income and expenses when money is received or paid. Industry research consistently indicates that approximately two-thirds of U.S. small businesses use the cash method, particularly among smaller, owner-managed firms.</p>
          <p>Cash-basis accounting aligns closely with how owners experience their businesses day-to-day. However, without proper preparation, it often produces financial records that are informal, inconsistent, difficult to standardize, and time-consuming to review professionally.</p>
          <p>These businesses are simple in theory, but messy in practice.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="problem-card">
          <h3>Why data quality matters</h3>
          <p>The consequences of disorganized financial data extend beyond bookkeeping inconvenience.</p>
          <p>Research from the JPMorgan Chase Institute shows that roughly half of small businesses operate with fewer than 15 days of cash buffer, making timely and accurate financial insight critical. Federal Reserve surveys further highlight rising operating costs, uneven cash flows, and increasing reliance on external advisors across this segment.</p>
          <p>When financial data is unclear or unreliable:</p>
          <div class="problem-list">
            <div>Business owners struggle to understand performance</div>
            <div>Advisors spend time fixing inputs instead of advising</div>
            <div>Lending, planning, and strategy conversations are delayed or weakened</div>
          </div>
          <p>The cost is not simply inefficiency — it is missed clarity at moments when clarity matters most.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="problem-card">
          <h3>Why this problem persists</h3>
          <p>This challenge is not caused by a lack of accounting software, bank feeds, or bookkeeping services. Small businesses already use all of these tools.</p>
          <p>What is missing is a dedicated financial data preparation layer — one designed specifically to take raw transaction activity and organize it into a clean, review-ready structure before professional accounting work begins.</p>
