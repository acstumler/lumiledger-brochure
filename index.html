        <h2>The Problem in Small-Business Financials</h2>
        <p class="problem-lede">A structural data problem — not a lack of effort or tools.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="problem-grid">
        <article class="problem-card">
          <h3>Where the breakdown starts</h3>
          <p>Most small businesses do not struggle because they ignore their finances. They struggle because the financial data they generate is not structured in a way that supports professional review or informed decision-making.</p>
          <p>For the majority of small businesses, records consist primarily of bank and credit card transactions spread across multiple accounts, platforms, and statements. While this activity reflects real economic behavior, it is rarely organized into a clean, consistent format before it reaches an accountant or advisor.</p>
          <div class="problem-list">
            <div>Fragmented across multiple sources</div>
            <div>Inconsistently categorized</div>
            <div>Poorly structured at the General Ledger level</div>
            <div>Difficult to trace back to original activity</div>
          </div>
          <p>Before any advisory, tax, or planning work can begin, a significant amount of time is spent reconstructing what already happened. This recurring cleanup is not an edge case — it is the norm.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="problem-card">
          <h3>Who this problem affects</h3>
          <p>Small businesses account for 99.9% of all U.S. businesses, with the vast majority employing fewer than 25 people. Firms of this size typically operate without internal accounting teams and rely on external CPAs or bookkeepers for financial review, compliance, and guidance.</p>
          <p>Within this segment, simplicity is not a preference — it is a necessity.</p>
          <p>Most businesses with 1–25 employees manage their finances using cash-basis accounting, recording income and expenses when money is received or paid. Industry research consistently indicates that approximately two-thirds of U.S. small businesses use the cash method, particularly among smaller, owner-managed firms.</p>
          <p>Cash-basis accounting aligns closely with how owners experience their businesses day-to-day. However, without proper preparation, it often produces financial records that are informal, inconsistent, difficult to standardize, and time-consuming to review professionally.</p>
          <p>These businesses are simple in theory, but messy in practice.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="problem-card">
          <h3>Why data quality matters</h3>
          <p>The consequences of disorganized financial data extend beyond bookkeeping inconvenience.</p>
          <p>Research from the JPMorgan Chase Institute shows that roughly half of small businesses operate with fewer than 15 days of cash buffer, making timely and accurate financial insight critical. Federal Reserve surveys further highlight rising operating costs, uneven cash flows, and increasing reliance on external advisors across this segment.</p>
          <p>When financial data is unclear or unreliable:</p>
          <div class="problem-list">
            <div>Business owners struggle to understand performance</div>
            <div>Advisors spend time fixing inputs instead of advising</div>
            <div>Lending, planning, and strategy conversations are delayed or weakened</div>
          </div>
          <p>The cost is not simply inefficiency — it is missed clarity at moments when clarity matters most.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="problem-card">
          <h3>Why this problem persists</h3>
          <p>This challenge is not caused by a lack of accounting software, bank feeds, or bookkeeping services. Small businesses already use all of these tools.</p>
          <p>What is missing is a dedicated financial data preparation layer — one designed specifically to take raw transaction activity and organize it into a clean, review-ready structure before professional accounting work begins.</p>
          <div class="problem-callout">
            LumiLedger addresses the structural gap between raw small-business transaction data and the clean financial inputs required for effective professional review.

        <h2>How LumiLedger Fills the Gap</h2>
        <p class="gap-lede">Small-business financial data does not fail because it is wrong — it fails because it is unprepared.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section-takeaway">
        LumiLedger prepares and explains small-business financial data so owners gain clarity without overwhelm and accounting professionals receive cleaner, more transparent inputs for review.
      </div>

      <div class="gap-grid">
        <article class="gap-card">
          <h3>Why preparation matters</h3>
          <p>Before accounting judgment can be applied, raw transaction activity must be organized, structured, and made understandable. Without this step, accounting professionals are forced to spend time reconstructing the past instead of advising on the future.</p>
          <p>Solving this problem does not require another accounting system. It requires a disciplined way to prepare financial data before professional work begins.</p>
          <p>That is the role LumiLedger is designed to play.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="gap-card">
          <h3>A preparation and interpretation layer — not an accounting system</h3>
          <p>LumiLedger is not a traditional accounting system or a bookkeeping service. It is a financial preparation, reporting, and interpretation layer that sits between raw transaction data and professional accounting judgment.</p>
          <p>LumiLedger can generate accurate financial statements for understanding and decision-making, but it does not replace a firm’s system of record, enforce accounting elections, or assert compliance authority. Final judgment and sign-off always remain with the accounting professional.</p>
          <p>This distinction is intentional.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="gap-card wide">
          <h3>How LumiLedger works</h3>
          <div class="gap-steps">
            <div>
              <div class="gap-step-title">1. Account connection</div>
              <p>Business owners connect the financial accounts used in the business — including bank accounts, credit cards, and loans. These accounts establish the known sources of financial activity.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <div class="gap-step-title">2. Transaction ingestion and journal logic</div>
              <p>Each transaction is evaluated using accounting logic. One side of the journal entry is anchored to a known source account (such as a bank or credit card liability). The offsetting side is automatically classified using machine-learned and AI-assisted logic. All classifications are transparent, reviewable, and adjustable.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <div class="gap-step-title">3. Financial statement generation</div>
              <p>From these journal entries, LumiLedger generates structured financial statements — including Income Statements, Balance Sheets, and General Ledger views — for analysis, review, and discussion.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <div class="gap-step-title">4. KPI calculation and financial storytelling</div>
              <p>LumiLedger calculates key performance indicators in the background and generates a plain-English financial story that explains what is happening in the business.</p>
              <div class="gap-list">
                <div>Day-to-day and week-to-week activity</div>
                <div>Month-over-month and quarter-over-quarter trends</div>
                <div>Year-over-year changes</div>
                <div>Notable shifts in cash flow, spending, or performance</div>
              </div>
              <p>The result is clarity without complexity.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </article>

        <article class="gap-card">
          <h3>Simplicity without oversimplification</h3>
          <p>Most financial software assumes accounting fluency and presents dense tables, charts, and metrics with little explanation. LumiLedger takes the opposite approach.</p>
          <p>Accounting structure is preserved in the background. On the surface, only what matters now is explained — clearly and in plain language.</p>
          <p>This allows business owners to stay informed without being inundated, while preserving the rigor professionals expect.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="gap-card">
          <h3>Data completeness and transparency</h3>
          <p>LumiLedger does not assume financial data is complete. It is source-driven.</p>
          <p>Every transaction is tied to a connected account, making coverage explicit. If an account is not connected or activity is missing, that gap remains visible rather than silently ignored. Financial narratives are written in the context of the data that exists.</p>
          <p>LumiLedger does not promise perfect inputs — it prevents undetected incompleteness.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="gap-card">
          <h3>Personal accounts used for business</h3>
          <p>LumiLedger is designed for real-world small businesses and assumes that personal accounts are often used for business activity.</p>
          <p>Personal bank or credit card accounts can be connected intentionally. Transactions are classified individually, allowing business and personal activity to be separated at the transaction level. Commingling is surfaced transparently rather than hidden.</p>
          <p>This preserves economic accuracy while allowing accounting professionals to advise appropriately.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="gap-card wide">
          <h3>When LumiLedger is sufficient — and when it hands off</h3>
          <p>For many small, cash-basis businesses, LumiLedger can serve as the primary financial tool for ongoing visibility, internal decision-making, advisor conversations, and lender preparation.</p>
          <p>When formal compliance, filing, or a system of record is required, LumiLedger hands off clean, well-structured data to an accounting platform such as QuickBooks, where professional judgment is finalized.</p>
          <p>This flexibility allows LumiLedger to meet businesses where they are — and grow with them.</p>

        <h2>How LumiLedger Is Built to Be Used — and to Grow</h2>
        <p class="growth-lede">LumiLedger is being developed with a deliberate, phased approach that reflects how small businesses operate and how accounting professionals adopt new tools.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section-takeaway">
        LumiLedger is built to earn trust first, support professional workflows second, and scale thoughtfully as clarity becomes a shared expectation rather than an exception.
      </div>

      <div class="growth-grid">
        <article class="growth-card">
          <h3>Why the phased approach matters</h3>
          <p>The goal is not rapid expansion at the expense of trust, but steady adoption grounded in real-world use.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="growth-card">
          <h3>Phase 1: Working alongside small accounting firms</h3>
          <p>LumiLedger is initially designed to work with small accounting firms that serve owner-managed businesses in the 1–25 employee range.</p>
          <div class="growth-list">
            <div>Regularly receive incomplete or disorganized financial data</div>
            <div>Spend significant time on cleanup before higher-value work begins</div>
            <div>Balance bookkeeping, review, and advisory services across a wide range of client sophistication</div>
          </div>
          <p>In this phase, LumiLedger is introduced to clients through trusted advisors or used collaboratively as a preparation tool. Clients benefit from clearer financial visibility, while firms receive cleaner, more consistent inputs.</p>
          <p>This phase prioritizes accuracy and transparency, real advisor feedback, alignment with existing workflows, and validation from daily use — not theoretical scale.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="growth-card">
          <h3>Phase 2: Firm partnerships and selective white-label use</h3>
          <p>As LumiLedger matures, it supports deeper firm-level use for practices that want standardization across clients.</p>
          <div class="growth-list">
            <div>Firm-specific views or dashboards</div>
            <div>Custom Chart of Accounts mappings</div>
            <div>Co-branded or white-label environments</div>
            <div>Tailored workflows aligned with firm processes</div>
          </div>
          <p>White labeling is optional and selective, not required. LumiLedger is designed to remain flexible, allowing firms to adopt it in the way that best fits their practice.</p>
          <p>The intent is to support firms that see LumiLedger as infrastructure — not to force a single operating model.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="growth-card wide">
          <h3>Phase 3: Direct-to-consumer expansion</h3>
          <p>Direct-to-consumer use becomes appropriate once the product is fully validated through professional use and supported by sufficient marketing and operational resources.</p>
          <div class="growth-list">
            <div>Reach business owners earlier</div>
            <div>Improve baseline financial literacy</div>
            <div>Reduce confusion before advisor engagement</div>
            <div>Scale access to clear financial understanding</div>
          </div>
          <p>Importantly, this phase builds on — rather than bypasses — professional involvement. LumiLedger remains compatible with accountants and advisors, regardless of how a client first encounters the product.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="growth-card wide">
          <h3>A product that grows with the business</h3>
          <p>Some businesses will use LumiLedger as their primary financial tool. Others will use it as a preparation layer feeding into a formal accounting system.</p>
          <p>LumiLedger is designed to support both paths.</p>
          <p>By focusing first on clarity, structure, and transparency, LumiLedger meets businesses where they are today — while remaining adaptable as their needs evolve.</p>
