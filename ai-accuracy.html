              <h3>AI as implementation, not identity</h3>
              <p>LumiLedger uses AI to assist with transaction classification and narrative generation. This is an implementation detail, not the product itself.</p>
              <p>The product is financial data preparation. AI is one of several tools used to achieve that goal.</p>
              <p>This distinction is intentional.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="content-card">
              <h3>Where AI is used</h3>
              <p>AI is applied in two primary areas within LumiLedger:</p>
              <p>Transaction classification: AI assists in determining the appropriate account category for the offsetting side of each journal entry.</p>
              <p>Narrative generation: AI generates plain-English explanations of financial trends, performance changes, and notable patterns.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="content-card">
              <h3>Where AI is not used</h3>
              <p>AI does not make accounting judgments, tax elections, or compliance determinations.</p>
              <p>AI does not infer missing data, estimate account balances, or fill gaps with assumptions.</p>
              <p>AI does not replace professional review or override user corrections.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="content-card wide">
              <h3>How transaction classification works</h3>
              <p>Each transaction imported into LumiLedger is evaluated for classification. The system uses a combination of machine-learned patterns and AI-assisted reasoning.</p>
              <div class="ai-process">
                <div class="process-step">
                  <div class="process-step-title">Pattern matching</div>
                  <p>The system first checks whether the transaction matches known patterns based on historical data, vendor memory, and user corrections.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="process-step">
                  <div class="process-step-title">AI reasoning</div>
                  <p>If no clear pattern exists, AI evaluates the transaction description, amount, and context to suggest a classification.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="process-step">
                  <div class="process-step-title">Confidence scoring</div>
                  <p>Each classification is assigned a confidence score. Low-confidence classifications are flagged for review.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="process-step">
                  <div class="process-step-title">User correction</div>
                  <p>Users and advisors can review, adjust, or override any classification. Corrections are stored and used to improve future accuracy.</p>
                </div>
              </div>
            </article>

            <article class="content-card">
              <h3>Transparency over confidence</h3>
              <p>LumiLedger does not hide uncertainty. When classification confidence is low, that uncertainty is surfaced.</p>
              <p>Transactions flagged for review are presented clearly. Users and advisors can prioritize attention where it is most needed.</p>
              <p>This approach favors transparency over false confidence.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="content-card">
              <h3>Learning from corrections</h3>
              <p>When a user or advisor corrects a classification, that correction is stored and applied to similar transactions in the future.</p>
              <p>Over time, the system adapts to business-specific patterns, vendor naming conventions, and user preferences.</p>
              <p>This learning process improves accuracy without reducing transparency.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="content-card">
              <h3>Narrative generation</h3>
              <p>LumiLedger generates plain-English financial narratives to explain what is happening in the business.</p>
              <p>These narratives are generated from structured financial data, not inferred from assumptions.</p>
              <p>Narratives describe observed trends and changes. They do not make predictions or offer strategic advice.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="content-card">
              <h3>Boundaries of narrative generation</h3>
              <p>Narratives explain what has happened, not what should happen.</p>
              <p>They identify trends and changes, but do not interpret causation or recommend actions.</p>
              <p>Strategic interpretation remains the domain of business owners and their advisors.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="content-card wide">
              <h3>Accuracy and validation</h3>
              <p>Classification accuracy is measured and monitored continuously. Accuracy rates are reviewed regularly by accounting professionals during development.</p>
              <p>Misclassifications are tracked, analyzed, and used to improve system logic.</p>
              <p>LumiLedger does not claim perfect accuracy. It claims continuous improvement and transparent uncertainty.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="content-card">
              <h3>Compliance boundaries</h3>
              <p>LumiLedger does not assert compliance authority. It does not make tax elections, enforce accounting standards, or certify financial statements.</p>
              <p>Generated financial statements are for understanding and analysis, not for filing or formal compliance.</p>
              <p>Final compliance authority remains with the accounting professional.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="content-card">
              <h3>Professional review and sign-off</h3>
              <p>LumiLedger is designed to reduce the time required for professional review, not eliminate it.</p>
              <p>Accounting professionals review prepared data, adjust as needed, and apply professional judgment before any formal use.</p>
              <p>This workflow preserves professional authority and ensures that AI assists rather than replaces judgment.</p>

            <article class="content-card">
              <h3>Data privacy and AI training</h3>
              <p>Financial data processed by LumiLedger is not used to train third-party AI models.</p>
              <p>Classification improvements are based on aggregated patterns, not individual transaction data.</p>
              <p>User data remains private and is never sold or shared outside of the system.</p>

              <p>System improvements are deployed regularly to refine classification logic, improve narrative quality, and reduce errors.</p>
              <p>LumiLedger is built for continuous improvement, not one-time deployment.</p>

            <article class="content-card">
              <h3>When AI is not enough</h3>
              <p>LumiLedger recognizes that AI-assisted classification is not sufficient for all businesses or all transactions.</p>
              <p>Complex accounting situations, unusual transactions, and industry-specific classifications require professional review.</p>
              <p>LumiLedger prepares data for that review rather than attempting to bypass it.</p>
